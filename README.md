**Project Title:** Cultures under stress: A cross-national meta-analysis of cortisol responses to the Trier Social Stress Test and their association with internalizing mental disorders and anxiety-based values

**Project Description:**
> Acute cortisol changes are physiological indicators (i.e., biomarkers) of psychosocial stress that have been repeatedly assessed using standardized laboratory protocols like the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Despite of this methodological standardization, however, cortisol stress responses vary considerably across different studies. Based on multilevel meta-analyses of 237 TSST studies (n = 8487 individuals), we demonstrate that ~25% of this variability is actually attributable to systematic differences between countries. Particularly North American and European studies show a remarkable effect disparity (d = 0.45 vs. d = 0.73).
In accordance with this finding, the increased prevalence of internalizing mental disorders (e.g. major depression or post-traumatic stress disorder) in English-speaking countries as reported by the WHO World Mental Health Surveys, a larger inequality of family incomes, larger population growth, larger expenses for health and the military, lower tax rates, and a cultural orientation towards anxiety-related values are accompanied by substantially decreased cortisol stress responses. Intriguingly, the size of these effects is comparable to the most important moderators of cortisol changes known to date, that is, male sex and higher age.
Proceeding from these results, we argue that the cortisol stress response may reflect the persistent threats in the sociocultural environment an individual is accustomed too. Highly competitive cultures emphasize the individualsâ€™ responsibility for socioeconomic prosperity, but simultaneously increase the collective population stress and thus lower sustainable ontogeny and resilience towards unexpected environmental adversity.

**Important Note:** The contents of the `qxf5t_src` folder were cloned from the OSF project on **12-03-2025**. Any changes made to the original OSF project after this date will not be reflected in this repository.

The `DESCRIPTION` file was automatically added to make this project Binder-ready. For more information on how R-based OSF projects are containerized, please refer to the `osf-to-binder` GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Code-Inspect/osf-to-binder](https://github.com/Code-Inspect/osf-to-binder)

## flowR Integration

This version of the repository has the **[flowR Addin](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr)** preinstalled. flowR allows visual design and execution of data analysis workflows within RStudio, supporting better reproducibility and modular analysis pipelines.

To use flowR, open the project in RStudio and go to `Addins` > `flowR`.

## How to Launch:

**Launch in your Browser:**

ðŸš€ **MyBinder:** [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/code-inspect-binder/osf_qxf5t-f/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

   * This will launch the project in an interactive RStudio environment in your web browser.
   * Please note that Binder may take a few minutes to build the environment.

ðŸš€ **NFDI JupyterHub:** [![NFDI](https://nfdi-jupyter.de/images/nfdi_badge.svg)](https://hub.nfdi-jupyter.de/r2d/gh/code-inspect-binder/osf_qxf5t-f/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio)

   * This will launch the project in an interactive RStudio environment on the NFDI JupyterHub platform.

**Access Downloaded Data:**
The downloaded data from the OSF project is located in the `qxf5t_src` folder.

## Run via Docker for Long-Term Reproducibility

In addition to launching this project using Binder or NFDI JupyterHub, you can reproduce the environment locally using Docker. This is especially useful for long-term access, offline use, or high-performance computing environments.

### Pull the Docker Image

```bash
docker pull meet261/repo2docker-qxf5t-f:latest
```

### Launch RStudio Server

Run the container (with a name, e.g. `rstudio-dev`):
```bash
docker run -it --name rstudio-dev --platform linux/amd64 -p 8888:8787 --user root meet261/repo2docker-qxf5t-f bash
```

Inside the container, start RStudio Server with no authentication:
```bash
/usr/lib/rstudio-server/bin/rserver --www-port 8787 --auth-none=1
```

Then, open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

> **Note:** If you're running the container on a remote server (e.g., via SSH), replace `localhost` with your server's IP address.
> For example: `http://<your-server-ip>:8888`
